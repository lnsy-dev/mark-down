# Bullet Animation Demo

Welcome to the bullet animation test!

---

## Progressive Reveal

This slide has a list that should reveal one item at a time:

- First bullet point (visible immediately)
- Second bullet point (press forward to reveal)
- Third bullet point (press forward again)
- Fourth bullet point (one more time)
- Fifth bullet point (final reveal)

---

## Another List

Testing with a different list:

1. Numbered item one
2. Numbered item two
3. Numbered item three

---

## Mixed Content

Some text before the list.

- Bullet A
- Bullet B
- Bullet C

And some text after the list.

---

## No List

This slide has no list items, so navigation should work normally.

---

## Final Slide

Thank you for testing!
