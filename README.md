# &lt;mark-down&gt; Element

An opinionated, dependency-free web vanilla js component that parses and renders Markdown with a suite of advanced features. Drop it into any project to bring rich text formatting to your content.

This component extends standard Markdown to include YAML Front Matter, wiki style links, task lists, asides. 

It is a little heavy (currently about 1mb, 372k gzipped), but it has a lot of "batteries included" features.

## Usage

Install via npm: 

```bash
npm install @lnsy/mark-down
```

Import the component into your project.

```js
import "@lnsy/mark-down";
```

or import via cdn: 

```js
import "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@lnsy/mark-down/dist/mark-down.min.js"
```

or include as a regular script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@lnsy/mark-down/dist/mark-down.min.js"></script>
```


Then, use the `<mark-down>` custom element in your HTML.

### Loading External Files

Use the `src` attribute to fetch and render a remote Markdown file.

```html
<mark-down src="./path/to/your/file.md"></mark-down>
```

### Inline Markdown

You can also place Markdown directly inside the element.

```html
<mark-down>
  # My Document Title

  This is a paragraph with some **bold** and _italic_ text.
</mark-down>
```

---

# Features

The `<mark-down>` element supports standard Markdown syntax and includes several powerful extensions.

### YAML Front Matter

You can include a YAML block at the top of your Markdown to define metadata. This data is automatically parsed and attached as attributes to the `<mark-down>` element itself.

**Example:**

```markdown
---
title: My Awesome Document
author: John Doe
version: 1.2.3
---

# Document Content

This document is titled "$title" and was written by $author.
```

The `title`, `author`, and `version` attributes will be set on the `<mark-down>` element, which you can inspect in the DOM.


### Variable Substitution

Variables defined in the YAML front matter can be injected directly into your Markdown content using a `$` prefix.

**Example:**

Given the front matter:
```yaml
---
username: Alex
status: active
---
```

This Markdown:
```markdown
User **$username** is currently **$status**.
```

Will be rendered as:
> User **Alex** is currently **active**.

### Custom Themes

For your convenience we use css variables to adjust color and sizes.

Override these variables in your css to change how it looks: 

```css
:root {  
  --bg-color: #FFF8E7;            
  --fg-color: #5b4931;
  --neutral-bg-color: #d7d0c5;    
  --neutral-fg-color: #5e5550;        
  --highlight-color: #FE7400;     
  --secondary-color: #564c2e;     
  --trinary-color: #475569;   
  --markdown-max-width: 40rem;  
  --markdown-aside-width: 20rem;  
  --code-secondary-highlight-color: var(--secondary-color);
  --code-foreground-color: var(--fg-color);
  --code-background-color: var(--neutral-bg-color);
  --code-highlight-color: var(--trinary-color);
  --code-neutral-color: var(--neutral-fg-color);
  --h1-font-size: 2rem;
  --h2-font-size: 1.8rem;
  --h3-font-size: 1.5rem;
  --font-size: 1.0rem;
  --line-height: 1.618rem;
}

```


### Task Lists

Create GitHub-style task lists. When a user clicks a checkbox, the component emits a `checkbox-clicked` custom event.

You can listen for this event to handle checkbox state changes. The event `detail` object contains the `content` of the clicked line and its `lineNumber` (0-indexed) in the source markdown.

**Example Event Listener:**

```javascript
document.querySelector('mark-down').addEventListener('checkbox-clicked', (e) => {
  console.log('Checkbox clicked:', e.detail);
  // e.g., { content: '- [ ] Write documentation', lineNumber: 2 }
});
```

**Example Markdown:**

```markdown
- [x] Complete initial setup
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Deploy to production
```

renders

- [x] Complete initial setup
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Deploy to production


### Wiki Style Links

Create internal links using the &#91;&#91;Page Name]] syntax, similar to Obsidian or TiddlyWiki.

By default, &#91;&#91;My Page]] will generate a link to `/My%20Page.html`.

**Example:**

```markdown
This document links to another page: [[Getting Started]].
```

You can customize the link behavior by setting the `wikilinks-search-prefix` attribute. If set, the link will become a search query.

**Example with `wikilinks-search-prefix="q"`:**

```html
<mark-down wikilinks-search-prefix="q">
  This is a link to [[Another Page]].
</mark-down>
```

This will generate a link to `/?q=Another%20Page`.

### Asides

Create side notes or callouts using a `:::` block. This is useful for highlighting important information.

**Example:**

:::
This is an aside. It can contain any other Markdown content, including lists, links, and code blocks.
:::


```markdown
:::
This is an aside. It can contain any other Markdown content, including lists, links, and code blocks.
:::
```


### Figure with Caption

Convert embedded images in wiki-style format with a caption on the next line into a `<figure>` with a `<figcaption>`.


![[https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C]] this is alt text
this is a caption


**Example:**


```md
![[this-is-an-image.png]] this is alt text
this is a caption
```


would compile to:
```html
<figure>
  <img src="this-is-an-image.png" alt="this is alt text">
  <figcaption>this is a caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

This feature supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.png`, and `.mp4` file endings.

### Citations

Add attributions or citations using the `cite:` marker.

**Example:**

```markdown
> The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
cite: Franklin D. Roosevelt
```

**generates**
> The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
cite: Franklin D. Roosevelt

### Footnotes

Add footnotes to your text for citations or additional information.

**Example:**

```markdown
Here is some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote content.
```

This will render the footnote at the bottom of the document.

Here is some text with a footnote.[^5]

[^5]: This is the footnote content.


### Abbreviations

Define abbreviations with their expansions, then write the short form in your text. At render time, occurrences are converted to semantic <abbr> elements with a title attribute.

How to define
- Place one definition per line: `*[TERM]: Expansion`
- Definitions can appear anywhere (commonly near the top) and are not shown in the rendered HTML.

Example

```
*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language
*[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium

HTML is standardized by the W3C.
```

Renders roughly as:

```
<p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is standardized by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>.</p>
```

*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language
*[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium


HTML is standardized by the W3C.

Notes
- Case-sensitive and whole-word matches.
- Expansions do not occur inside fenced code blocks or inline code spans.

### Subscript and Superscript

Use subscript and superscript notation for chemistry, math, and ordinals.

- Subscript: wrap content with `~` (tilde) — example: `H~2~O`
- Superscript: wrap content with `^` (caret) — example: `E = mc^2^`

**Example Markdown:**

```markdown
Water: H~2~O
Energy: E = mc^2^
Ordinal: 29^th^
```

**Compiles roughly to:**

```html
<p>Water: H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>Energy: E = mc<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Ordinal: 29<sup>th</sup></p>
```

Water: H~2~O
Energy: E = mc^2^
Ordinal: 29^th^


Notes:
- Works inline alongside other Markdown.
- Does not affect content inside code spans or fenced code blocks.


### Code Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically highlighted using `highlight.js`. The language is auto-detected, but you can also specify it.

**Example:**

````markdown
```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
````

renders:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

# Local Development

### Output Filename

You can customize the build output by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project.

To change the name of the output file, set the `OUTPUT_FILE_NAME` variable in your `.env` file.

**.env**
```
OUTPUT_FILE_NAME=my-custom-filename.js
```

If this variable is not set, the output file will default to `dist/main.min.js`.

### Development Server Port

You can also change the development server port by setting the `PORT` variable in your `.env` file.

**.env**
```
PORT=8080
```

If this variable is not set, the port will default to `3000`.

## Running the Project

To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a development server. By default, it runs on port 3000. You can view the project in your browser.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the bundled and optimized files.
